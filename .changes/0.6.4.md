## 0.6.4 - 2023-04-20
### Added
* New schema_resolver_version config option. Defaults to 1 which means no change for existing users. Users can opt into a version 2 which is much more resilient and will fallback to JSON columns when unable to resolve a particular property. This option is only used when denormalized=True
