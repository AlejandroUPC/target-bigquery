## 0.6.3 - 2023-03-15
### Added
* Establish message passing pattern from workers to main thread for process introspectability
* Bubble up errors from workers and reraise in main thread with traceback info
* Option to ignore failures in workers via fail_fast config option. This option is set to True and you must explicitly set fail fast to false if you want to process to ignore row insertion errors
### Fixed
* Manage offset in sink class instead of on workers so the stream payload always has the correct offset
